# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This is my first end-to-end machine learning project where I built a model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic, using features such as age, gender, class, fare, and more.

Although the dataset is widely used for beginners, I treated this as a full production-style project — and faced some challenges, especially while linking files, building pipelines, and resolving unexpected errors.

This project didn’t just teach me theory — it taught me how to debug pipelines, and think like an engineer.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Performed *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* using Pandas and Seaborn
- Handled *missing values, **categorical encoding, and **feature selection*
- Built and evaluated models: *Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest*
- Achieved an accuracy of *~81%* on the test set
- Built a *Streamlit web app* to deploy the final model
